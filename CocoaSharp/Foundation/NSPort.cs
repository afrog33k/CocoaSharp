Communication occurs between NSPort objects, which typically reside in different threads or tasks. The distributed objects system uses NSPort objects to send NSPortMessage objects back and forth. You should implement interapplication communication using distributed objects whenever possible and use NSPort objects only when necessary.	/// </summary>	[iOSVersion(2)]	public class NSPort : NSObject	{		/// <summary>		/// Marks the receiver as invalid and posts an NSPortDidBecomeInvalidNotification to the default notification center.		/// </summary>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("invalidate")]		public void Invalidate() { }				/// <summary>		/// Sets the receiver’s delegate to a given object.		/// </summary>		/// <param name="anObject">The delegate for the receiver.</param>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("setDelegate")]		public void SetDelegate(NSPortDelegate anObject) { }				/// <summary>		/// Returns the receiver’s delegate.		/// </summary>		/// <returns>The receiver’s delegate.</returns>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("delegate")]		public NSPortDelegate Delegate() { return null; }				/// <summary>		/// This method is provided for subclasses that have custom types of NSPort.		/// </summary>		/// <param name="limitDate">The last instant that a message may be sent.</param>		/// <param name="components">The message components.</param>		/// <param name="from">The receive port.</param>		/// <param name="reserved">The number of bytes reserved for the header.</param>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("sendBeforeDate")]		public bool SendBeforeDate(NSDate limitDate, NSMutableArray components, NSPort from, int reserved) { return false; }				/// <summary>		/// This method is provided for subclasses that have custom types of NSPort.		/// </summary>		/// <param name="limitDate">The last instant that a message may be sent.</param>		/// <param name="msgid">The message ID.</param>		/// <param name="components">The message components.</param>		/// <param name="from">The receive port.</param>		/// <param name="reserved">The number of bytes reserved for the header.</param>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("sendBeforeDate")]		public bool SendBeforeDate(NSDate limitDate, int msgid, NSMutableArray components, NSPort from, int reserved) { return false; }				/// <summary>		/// Returns the number of bytes of space reserved by the receiver for sending data.		/// </summary>		/// <returns>The number of bytes reserved by the receiver for sending data.
