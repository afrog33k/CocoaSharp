Purging these bytes may be advantageous for your system, because doing so frees up memory needed by other applications. The NSPurgeableData class provides a default implementation of the NSDiscardableContent protocol, from which it inherits its interface.	/// </summary>	/// <see cref="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSPurgeableData_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSPurgeableData"/>	[iOSVersion(4)]	public class NSPurgeableData : NSMutableData, AnyObject, NSCoding, NSCopying, NSDiscardableContent, NSMutableCopying, NSObjectProtocol, NSSecureCoding	{	}}
