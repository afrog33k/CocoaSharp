A condition object acts as both a lock and a checkpoint in a given thread. The lock protects your code while it tests the condition and performs the task triggered by the condition. The checkpoint behavior requires that the condition be true before the thread proceeds with its task. While the condition is not true, the thread blocks. It remains blocked until another thread signals the condition object.    /// </summary>    /// <see cref="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSCondition_class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSCondition"/>    [iOSVersion(2)]    [Export("")]    public class NSCondition : NSObject//, AnyObject, CVarArgType, Equatable, Hashable, NSLocking, NSObjectProtocol, Printable    {        public NSCondition() { }        /// <summary>        /// Blocks the current thread until the condition is signaled.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(2)]        [Export("wait")]        public virtual void Wait() {  }                /// <summary>        /// Blocks the current thread until the condition is signaled or the specified time limit is reached.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="limit">The time at which to wake up the thread if the condition has not been signaled.</param>        [iOSVersion(2)]        [Export("waitUntilDate")]        public virtual bool WaitUntilDate(NSDate limit) { return default(bool); }                /// <summary>        /// Signals the condition, waking up one thread waiting on it.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(2)]        [Export("signal")]        public virtual void Signal() {  }                /// <summary>        /// Signals the condition, waking up all threads waiting on it.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(2)]        [Export("broadcast")]        public virtual void Broadcast() {  }                /// <summary>        /// The name of the condition.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(2)]        [Export("name")]        [Optional]        public string Name { get; set; }    }}
