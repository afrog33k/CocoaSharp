Data objects let simple allocated buffers (that is, data with no embedded pointers) take on the behavior of Foundation objects. They are typically used for data storage and are also useful in Distributed Objects applications, where data contained in data objects can be copied or moved between applications. NSData creates static data objects, and NSMutableData creates dynamic data objects. You can easily convert one type of data object to the other with the initializer that takes an NSData object or an  NSMutableData object as an argument.    /// </summary>    /// <see cref="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSMutableData_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/NSMutableData"/>    [iOSVersion(2)]    [Export("")]    public class NSMutableData : NSData//, AnyObject, CKRecordValue, CVarArgType, Equatable, Hashable, NSCoding, NSCopying, NSMutableCopying, NSObjectProtocol, NSSecureCoding, Printable    {        public NSMutableData() { }        /// <summary>        /// Increases the length of the receiver by a given number of bytes.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="extraLength">The number of bytes by which to increase the receiver&#39;s length.</param>        [iOSVersion(2)]        [Export("increaseLengthBy")]        public virtual void IncreaseLengthBy(int extraLength) {  }                /// <summary>        /// Appends to the receiver a given number of bytes from a given buffer.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="bytes">A buffer containing data to append to the receiver&#39;s content.</param>        /// <param name="length">The number of bytes from bytes to append.</param>        [iOSVersion(2)]        [Export("appendBytes")]        public virtual void AppendBytes(UnsafePointer bytes, int length) {  }                /// <summary>        /// Appends the content of another NSData object to the receiver.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="otherData">The data object whose content is to be appended to the contents of the receiver.</param>        [iOSVersion(2)]        [Export("appendData")]        public virtual void AppendData(NSData otherData) {  }                /// <summary>        /// Replaces with a given set of bytes a given range within the contents of the receiver.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="range">The range within the receiver&#39;s contents to replace with bytes.
