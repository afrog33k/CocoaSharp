After being added to a queue, an operation remains in that queue until it is explicitly canceled or finishes executing its task. Operations within the queue (but not yet executing) are themselves organized according to priority levels and inter-operation object dependencies and are executed accordingly. An application may create multiple operation queues and submit operations to any of them.	/// </summary>	[iOSVersion(2)]	public class NSOperationQueue : NSObject	{		/// <summary>		/// Returns the operation queue that launched the current operation.		/// </summary>		/// <returns>The operation queue that started the operation or nil if the queue could not be determined.</returns>		[iOSVersion(4)]		[Export("currentQueue")]		public static NSOperationQueue CurrentQueue() { return null; }				/// <summary>		/// Returns the operation queue associated with the main thread.		/// </summary>		/// <returns>The default operation queue bound to the main thread.</returns>		[iOSVersion(4)]		[Export("mainQueue")]		public static NSOperationQueue MainQueue() { return null; }				/// <summary>		/// Adds the specified operation object to the receiver.		/// </summary>		/// <param name="operation">The operation object to be added to the queue.
