    /// <summary>
    /// The CGAffineTransform data structure represents a matrix used for affine transformations. A transformation specifies how points in one coordinate system map to points in another coordinate system. An affine transformation is a special type of mapping that preserves parallel lines in a path but does not necessarily preserve lengths or angles. Scaling, rotation, and translation are the most commonly used manipulations supported by affine transforms, but skewing is also possible.
