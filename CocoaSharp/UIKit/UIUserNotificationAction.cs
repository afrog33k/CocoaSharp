When a notification is delivered, the system displays a button for each custom action associated with the notification. Tapping a button launches your app (either in the foreground or background) and gives you a chance to perform the indicated action. You use this class to specify the text that is displayed in the button and the information your app needs to perform the corresponding action.	/// </summary>	[iOSVersion(8)]	public class UIUserNotificationAction : NSObject	{		/// <summary>		/// The string that you use internally to identify the action.
