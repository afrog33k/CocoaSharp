As a device moves, its hardware reports linear acceleration changes along the primary axes in three-dimensional space. You can use this data to detect both the current orientation of the device (relative to the ground) and any instantaneous changes to that orientation. You might use instantaneous changes as input to a game or to initiate some action in your application.	/// </summary>	[iOSVersion(2)]	public class UIAccelerometer : NSObject	{		/// <summary>		/// Returns the shared accelerometer object for the system.		/// </summary>		/// <returns>The systemwide accelerometer object.</returns>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("sharedAccelerometer")]		public static UIAccelerometer SharedAccelerometer() { return null; }				/// <summary>		/// The interval at which to deliver acceleration data to the delegate.		/// </summary>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("updateinterval")]		public NSTimeinterval Updateinterval { get; set; }				/// <summary>		/// The delegate object you want to receive acceleration events.		/// </summary>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("delegate")]		public UIAccelerometerDelegate Delegate { get; set; }	}}
