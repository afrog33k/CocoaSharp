The user must press one or more fingers on a view and hold them there for a minimum period of time before the action triggers. While down, the userâ€™s fingers may not move more than a specified distance; if they move beyond the specified distance, the gesture fails.	/// </summary>	[iOSVersion(3.2)]	public class UILongPressGestureRecognizer : UIGestureRecognizer	{		/// <summary>		/// The minimum period fingers must press on the view for the gesture to be recognized.		/// </summary>		[iOSVersion(3.2)]		[Export("minimumPressDuration")]		public CFTimeinterval MinimumPressDuration { get; set; }				/// <summary>		/// The number of fingers that must be pressed on the view for the gesture to be recognized.		/// </summary>		[iOSVersion(3.2)]		[Export("numberOfTouchesRequired")]		public int NumberOfTouchesRequired { get; set; }				/// <summary>		/// The number of taps on the view required for the gesture to be recognized.		/// </summary>		[iOSVersion(3.2)]		[Export("numberOfTapsRequired")]		public int NumberOfTapsRequired { get; set; }				/// <summary>		/// The maximum movement of the fingers on the view before the gesture fails.		/// </summary>		[iOSVersion(3.2)]		[Export("allowableMovement")]		public CGFloat AllowableMovement { get; set; }	}}
