From the time a view controller is presented until the time it is dismissed, UIKit uses a presentation controller to manage various aspects of the presentation process for that view controller. The presentation controller can add its own animations on top of those provided by animator objects, it can respond to size changes, and it can manage other aspects of how the view controller is presented onscreen.    /// </summary>    /// <see cref="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIPresentationController_class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/UIPresentationController"/>    [iOSVersion(8)]    public class UIPresentationController : NSObject//, AnyObject, NSObjectProtocol, UIAppearanceContainer, UIContentContainer, UITraitEnvironment    {        /// <summary>        /// The view to be animated during the presentation.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(8)]        [Export("presentedView")]        public UIView PresentedView() { return default(UIView); }                /// <summary>        /// The frame rectangle to assign to the presented view at the end of the animations.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(8)]        [Export("frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView")]        public CGRect FrameOfPresentedViewInContainerView() { return default(CGRect); }                /// <summary>        /// Notifies the presentation controller that layout is about to begin on the views of the container view.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(8)]        [Export("containerViewWillLayoutSubviews")]        public void ContainerViewWillLayoutSubviews() {  }                /// <summary>        /// Called to notify the presentation controller that layout ended on the views of the container view.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(8)]        [Export("containerViewDidLayoutSubviews")]        public void ContainerViewDidLayoutSubviews() {  }                /// <summary>        /// Notifies the presentation controller that the presentation animations are about to start.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(8)]        [Export("presentationTransitionWillBegin")]        public void PresentationTransitionWillBegin() {  }                /// <summary>        /// Notifies the presentation controller that the presentation animations finished.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="completed">true if the animations completed and the presented view controller is now visible or false if the animations were canceled and the presenting view controller is still visible.</param>        [iOSVersion(8)]        [Export("presentationTransitionDidEnd")]        public void PresentationTransitionDidEnd(bool completed) {  }                /// <summary>        /// Notifies the presentation controller that the dismissal animations are about to start.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(8)]        [Export("dismissalTransitionWillBegin")]        public void DismissalTransitionWillBegin() {  }                /// <summary>        /// Notifies the presentation controller that the dismissal animations finished.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="completed">true if the animations completed and the presented view controller was dismissed or false if the animations were canceled and the presented view controller is still visible.</param>        [iOSVersion(8)]        [Export("dismissalTransitionDidEnd")]        public void DismissalTransitionDidEnd(bool completed) {  }                /// <summary>        /// Returns the presentation style to use when the app’s size changes.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(8)]        [Export("adaptivePresentationStyle")]        public UIModalPresentationStyle AdaptivePresentationStyle() { return default(UIModalPresentationStyle); }                /// <summary>        /// A Boolean value indicating whether the presentation covers the entire screen.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(8)]        [Export("shouldPresentInFullscreen")]        public bool ShouldPresentInFullscreen() { return default(bool); }                /// <summary>        /// A Boolean value indicating whether the presenting view controller’s view should be removed when the presentation animations finish.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(8)]        [Export("shouldRemovePresentersView")]        public bool ShouldRemovePresentersView() { return default(bool); }                /// <summary>        /// The view controller that is the starting point for the presentation.
