For example, a view might contain icons or drawn text that, to end users, appear and function as separate items. But because these components are not implemented as instances of UIView, they are not automatically accessible to users with disabilities. Therefore, such a container view should implement the  UIAccessibilityContainer methods to supply accessibility information about these components to assistive applications such as VoiceOver.    /// </summary>    /// <see cref="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIAccessibilityContainer_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008787"/>    [iOSVersion(3)]    public interface UIAccessibilityContainer//:    {    }}
