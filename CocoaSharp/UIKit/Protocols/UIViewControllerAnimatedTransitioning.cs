The methods in this protocol let you define an animator object, which creates the animations for transitioning a view controller on or off screen in a fixed amount of time. The animations you create using this protocol must not be interactive. To create interactive transitions, you must combine your animator object with another object that controls the timing of your animations.    /// </summary>    /// <see cref="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning"/>    [iOSVersion(7)]    public interface UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning//: NSObjectProtocol    {        /// <summary>        /// Tells your animator object to perform the transition animations.
