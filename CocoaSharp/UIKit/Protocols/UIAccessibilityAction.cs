For example, to respond to a scrolling gesture, you implement the accessibilityScroll: method and post UIAccessibilityPageScrolledNotification with the new page status (such as “Page 3 of 9”). Or, to make an element such as a slider or picker view accessible, you first need to characterize it by including the UIAccessibilityTraitAdjustable trait. Then, you must implement the accessibilityIncrement and accessibilityDecrement methods. When you do this, assistive technology users can adjust the element using gestures specific to the assistive technology.    /// </summary>    /// <see cref="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIAccessibilityAction_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009678"/>    [iOSVersion(4)]    [Export("")]    public interface UIAccessibilityAction//:    {        /// <summary>        /// Tells the element to activate itself and report the success or failure of the operation.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(7)]        [Export("accessibilityActivate")]        bool AccessibilityActivate();                /// <summary>        /// Tells the accessibility element to increment the value of its content.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(4)]        [Export("accessibilityIncrement")]        void AccessibilityIncrement();                /// <summary>        /// Tells the accessibility element to decrement the value of its content.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(4)]        [Export("accessibilityDecrement")]        void AccessibilityDecrement();                /// <summary>        /// Scrolls screen content in an application-specific way and returns the success or failure of the action.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="direction">A constant that specifies the direction of the scrolling action.
