When you want to present a view controller using a custom modal presentation type, set its modalTransitionStyle property to UIModalPresentationCustom and assign an object that conforms to this protocol to its transitioningDelegate property. When you present that view controller, UIKit queries your transitioning delegate for the objects to use when animating the view controller into position.    /// </summary>    /// <see cref="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate_protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate"/>    [iOSVersion(7)]    [Export("")]    public interface UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate//: NSObjectProtocol    {        /// <summary>        /// Asks your delegate for the transition animator object to use when presenting a view controller.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="presented">The view controller object that is about to be presented onscreen.</param>        /// <param name="presentingController">The view controller that is presenting the view controller in the presented parameter.
