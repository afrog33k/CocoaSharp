Specifically, the methods of the app delegate give you a chance to respond to important changes. For example, you use the methods of the app delegate to respond to state transitions, such as when your app moves from foreground to background execution, and to respond to incoming notifications. In many cases, the methods of the app delegate are the only way to receive these important notifications.    /// </summary>    /// <see cref="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/UIApplicationDelegate"/>    [iOSVersion(2)]    public interface UIApplicationDelegate//: NSObjectProtocol    {        /// <summary>        /// Tells the delegate that the launch process has begun but that state restoration has not yet occurred.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="application">The singleton app object.</param>        /// <param name="willFinishLaunchingWithOptions">A dictionary indicating the reason the app was launched (if any).
