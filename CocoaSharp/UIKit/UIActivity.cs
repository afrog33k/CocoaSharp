For example, an social media service might take whatever text, images, or other content is provided to it and post them to the userâ€™s account. Activity objects are used in conjunction with a UIActivityViewController object, which is responsible for presenting services to the user.    /// </summary>    /// <see cref="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIActivity_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/UIActivity"/>    [iOSVersion(6)]    public class UIActivity : NSObject//, AnyObject, NSObjectProtocol    {        public UIActivity() { }        /// <summary>        /// Returns the category of the activity, which may be used to group activities in the UI.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(7)]        [Export("activityCategory")]        public static UIActivityCategory ActivityCategory() { return default(UIActivityCategory); }                /// <summary>        /// An identifier for the type of service being provided.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(6)]        [Export("activityType")]        public virtual string ActivityType() { return default(string); }                /// <summary>        /// A user-readable string describing the service.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(6)]        [Export("activityTitle")]        public virtual string ActivityTitle() { return default(string); }                /// <summary>        /// An image that identifies the service to the user.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(6)]        [Export("activityImage")]        public virtual UIImage ActivityImage() { return default(UIImage); }                /// <summary>        /// Returns a Boolean indicating whether the service can act on the specified data items.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="activityItems">An array of objects of varying types.
