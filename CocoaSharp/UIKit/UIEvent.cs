There are three general types of event: touch events, motion events, and remote-control events. Remote-control events allow a responder object to receive commands from an external accessory or headset so that it can manage manage audio and videoâ€”for example, playing a video or skipping to the next audio track. Motion events were introduced in iOS 3.0 and remote-control events in iOS 4.0.	/// </summary>	[iOSVersion(2)]	public class UIEvent : NSObject	{		/// <summary>		/// Returns all touch objects associated with the receiver.		/// </summary>		/// <returns>A set of UITouch objects representing all touches associated with an event (represented by the receiver).</returns>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("allTouches")]		public NSSet AllTouches() { return null; }				/// <summary>		/// Returns the touch objects that belong to a given view for the event represented by the receiver.		/// </summary>		/// <param name="view">TheUIView object on which the touches related to the event were made.</param>		/// <returns>A set of UITouch objects representing the touches for the specified view related to the event represented by the receiver.</returns>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("touchesForView")]		public NSSet TouchesForView(UIView view) { return null; }				/// <summary>		/// Returns the touch objects that belong to a given window for the event represented by the receiver.		/// </summary>		/// <param name="window">The UIWindow object on which the touches related to the event were made.</param>		/// <returns>A set of UITouch objects representing the touches for the specified window related to the event represented by the receiver.</returns>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("touchesForWindow")]		public NSSet TouchesForWindow(UIWindow window) { return null; }				/// <summary>		/// The time when the event occurred.
