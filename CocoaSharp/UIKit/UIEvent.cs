There are three general types of event: touch events, motion events, and remote-control events. Remote-control events allow a responder object to receive commands from an external accessory or headset so that it can manage manage audio and videoâ€”for example, playing a video or skipping to the next audio track. Motion events were introduced in iOS 3.0 and remote-control events in iOS 4.0.    /// </summary>    /// <see cref="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIEvent_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/UIEvent"/>    [iOSVersion(2)]    public class UIEvent : NSObject//, AnyObject, NSObjectProtocol    {        public UIEvent() { }        /// <summary>        /// Returns all touch objects associated with the receiver.        /// </summary>        [iOSVersion(2)]        [Export("allTouches")]        public virtual NSSet AllTouches() { return default(NSSet); }                /// <summary>        /// Returns the touch objects that belong to a given view for the event represented by the receiver.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="view">TheUIView object on which the touches related to the event were made.</param>        [iOSVersion(2)]        [Export("touchesForView")]        public virtual NSSet TouchesForView(UIView view) { return default(NSSet); }                /// <summary>        /// Returns the touch objects that belong to a given window for the event represented by the receiver.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="window">The UIWindow object on which the touches related to the event were made.</param>        [iOSVersion(2)]        [Export("touchesForWindow")]        public virtual NSSet TouchesForWindow(UIWindow window) { return default(NSSet); }                /// <summary>        /// Returns the touch objects that are being delivered to the specified gesture recognizer.        /// </summary>        /// <param name="gesture">An instance of a subclass of the abstract base class UIGestureRecognizer.
